![ORU Mobile Assignment](https://github.com/gauravsingh94/ORU-Phones-Assignment/assets/99260988/95911bc0-21f6-416b-95fe-bf3481992cae)

## Overview

Welcome to the FullStack Assignment from Oru-Phones project! This README file will guide you through the functionalities and features of our application. We have converted a Figma design into a complete Next.js application that facilitates connections among users based on shared skills and interests. Our application incorporates cutting-edge technologies and tools to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** Our application's frontend is built using Next.js, a renowned React framework that enables server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.

- **Styling:** We've employed Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to craft visually appealing and responsive frontend designs.

- **Authentication:** We prioritize security using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ensuring only authorized access to different parts of the platform.

- **Database:** MongoDB serves as the backbone of our data management. Its flexibility and scalability empower us to manage user information and connections effectively.

- **Connection Suggestions:** Our platform goes beyond the norm by suggesting connections with individuals who share similar skills. This advanced recommendation system enhances user engagement and expands networks.

- **Deployment:** We've deployed our application using Vercel, a cloud platform that supports static sites and serverless functions. The deployment includes both a fully functional site and a frontend-only link for responsive design testing.
